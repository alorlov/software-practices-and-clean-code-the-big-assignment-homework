# Software practices and clean code - The big assignment homework

This repository is for homework part of a course called [*Software practices and clean code*](http://bit.ly/software-practices-12-99-march).

The idea is that the code is a mess. The names for variables, classes, and methods won't be good. Classes won't be separated the right way. There will be coupling. After every section you will need to fix the part of the code you learned about. In the beginning, we will start with crappy code and in the end, you will fix the code and it will look professional and easy to read.
